# CO₂ Emission Prediction Project

## 🌍 Overview

This project explores the patterns and relationships in global CO₂ emissions and energy usage. Through data visualization and analysis, we aim to uncover meaningful insights and inform predictive modeling strategies.

## 📊 Objectives

* Analyze the relationship between CO₂ emissions, energy use, and other socioeconomic factors
* Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies across countries and regions
* Select appropriate machine learning models for accurate prediction of CO₂ emissions

## 📈 Key Insights from Data Exploration

### 📊 Feature Relationships

* **CO₂ emissions per capita** show a **strong linear correlation** with **energy use per capita**.
* Nonlinear relationships were observed between CO₂ emissions and other variables.
* **Energy use per capita** is a robust predictor and will be retained for modeling.
* **Population count** is **not relevant** to the target prediction and will be excluded from further analysis.

### 🌐 Country and Global Trends

* Both **country-specific** and **global trends** are evident.
* Some global trends diverge into **distinct paths for country clusters**, suggesting region-specific behaviors.

### ⚠️ Outlier Detection

* Countries like the **United Arab Emirates (ARE)** significantly deviate from global trends.
* These outliers must be considered carefully during modeling and data preparation.



## 📅 Next Steps

* Feature engineering and normalization based on insights
* Train/test split and model development
* Model evaluation using RMSE, R², and other metrics

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
* Scikit-learn for modeling (planned)
